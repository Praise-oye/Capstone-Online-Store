# Capstone-Online-Store
This is a Capstone Project for level 1 of the Full-Stack Web development boot camp at HyperionDev. The assignment was to create a functional shopping cart for your online store.
The shopping cart allows customers to effortlessly browse through the online store, select desired items, and add them to their cart. The cart maintains a list of selected products and their corresponding quantities and prices. It ensures that the customer's choices are preserved during their shopping journey, even if they navigate to different pages or temporarily leave the website.
The shopping cart also incorporates features like updating item quantities, enabling customers to modify their choices before checkout. It calculates the subtotal, including applicable taxes or discounts, to provide an accurate and transparent purchase overview. Additionally, the cart may offer functionalities such as applying coupon codes.
